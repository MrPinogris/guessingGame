is for the guessing game, the goal is to guess the mob 
with random info given from the JSON you make from this
 wiki page take note's from the one you made in the last

## promt 2 for getting the info from the wiki

make it in the format like this and don't give the name 
of the mob in any of the hints and put it in code format
so I can copy it easyer:


"axolotl": {
        "name": "Axolotl",
        "hints": [
          { "text": "A passive bucketable aquatic mob", "difficulty": 1 },

        ],
        "technical_info": {

          "spawn_conditions": [
